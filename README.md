### Hello

website: https://spacedust.ca/  
gitcat: https://gitcat.ca/endigma

### Why are all my projects mirrors?

I'm a believer in self-hosting and remaining not critically dependent on services others are responsible for. My self-hosted git site (gitcat.ca) is running on Gitea and provides the features I require without outsourcing to another company.
